# RNA (Royal Neighbors of America) Action Mapping Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an improved email action assignment system for Royal Neighbors of America based on their carrier status codes and indications from the CSV file.

## Deployment Details
- **Function**: `analyze-email-royal-neighbors`
- **Version**: 14 (newly deployed)
- **Status**: ACTIVE ✅
- **Deployment Date**: October 14, 2025

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Status Code Categories Implemented**

#### Failed Payment - Insufficient Funds
- **NSF CHECK RETURNED**
- **Insufficient Funds**
- **GHL Stage**: `FDPF Insufficient Funds`
- **Note Template**: "Failed Payment due to insufficient Funds\n\nNeed to call client back and schedule a policy redate"

#### Failed Payment - Incorrect Banking Info
- **NSF ACCOUNT CLOSED** - Account closed
- **Account Closed**
- **NSF OTHER** - No account to locate or payment stopped by bank
- **Payment Stopped**
- **GHL Stage**: `FDPF Incorrect Banking Info`
- **Note Template**: "Failed Payment due to incorrect banking info\n\nNeed to reconfirm banking information and redate policy"

#### Cancellations and Withdrawals
- **CON TERM WITHDRAWN** - Client cancelled or agent license invalid
  - **GHL Stage**: `Needs manual check`
  - **Note**: "Needs manual check"

- **CON TERM NT NO PAY** - Client called to cancel
- **Client Cancellation**
  - **GHL Stage**: `Chargeback Cancellation`
  - **Note**: "Client called to cancel their Policy"

#### Declined After Underwriting
- **CON TERM DECLINED**
- **Declined Underwriting**
- **GHL Stage**: `Declined Underwriting`
- **Note**: "The Application got Declined Underwriting"

#### Pending/Suspended Status
- **CON SUS HOME OFFICE** - Client cancelled or requested no billing this month
- **Suspended**
- **GHL Stage**: `FDPF Pending Reason`
- **Note**: "Need to contact carrier to find the reason for failed payment"

#### Incomplete Applications
- **CON TERM INCOMPLETE** - Missing underwriting requirements
- **Incomplete Application**
- **GHL Stage**: `Application Withdrawn`
- **Note**: "Policy closed as incomplete due to client information discrepancy. Need to reconfirm personal details and submit with another carrier"

#### Lapsed Policies
- **CON TERM LAPSED** - Policy lapsed due to non-payment
- **Lapsed Policy**
- **Pending Lapse**
- **GHL Stage**: `Chargeback Failed Payment` or `Pending Lapse`
- **Note**: "Policy is pending lapse. Need to reconfirm banking information and request a redraft"

### 2. **AI Analysis Enhancements**

The AI prompt has been updated to:
- Scan email body for specific RNA status codes (NSF, CON TERM, CON SUS)
- Prioritize exact status code matches over general categorization
- Extract RNA-specific terminology and certificate numbers
- Identify urgent situations requiring immediate attention

### 3. **Database Category Mapping**

The function now maps RNA status codes to database-allowed categories:

```typescript
'NSF CHECK RETURNED' → 'Failed payment'
'CON TERM NT NO PAY' → 'Cancelled policy'
'CON TERM DECLINED' → 'Declined/Closed as Incomplete'
'CON TERM INCOMPLETE' → 'Declined/Closed as Incomplete'
'CON SUS HOME OFFICE' → 'Pending'
'CON TERM LAPSED' → 'Pending Lapse'
'Policy Changes' → 'Post Underwriting Update'
```

### 4. **Action Mapping Logic**

The function uses a smart matching system:
1. **Exact Match**: Checks for exact status code match
2. **Partial Match**: Looks for similar/containing terms
3. **Fallback**: Defaults to "Other" category with manual check

### 5. **GHL Stages Supported**

All GHL stages from the RNA carrier status list:
- ✅ FDPF Insufficient Funds
- ✅ FDPF Incorrect Banking Info
- ✅ FDPF Unauthorized Draft
- ✅ Pending Failed Payment Fix
- ✅ Pending Lapse
- ✅ Chargeback Failed Payment
- ✅ Chargeback Cancellation
- ✅ Declined Underwriting
- ✅ Application Withdrawn
- ✅ Needs manual check
- ✅ Post Underwriting Update
- ✅ Pending

## Data Flow

```

AI Analysis (Groq API)
    ↓
Extract Status Code/Category
    ↓
Match to RNA Action Mapping

Generate:
  - action_code (original category)
  - ghl_note (template)
  - ghl_stage (workflow stage)
  - category (database category)
    ↓
Save to email_analysis_results table
```

## Database Fields Populated

- `action_code`: Original RNA status code
- `ghl_note`: Pre-formatted note template for action
- `ghl_stage`: GHL workflow stage for routing
- `category`: Standardized database category
- `indication`: Full RNA indication text
- `customer_name`: Extracted member name
- `policy_id`: Certificate/policy number
- `reason`: Specific reason from status code
- `summary`: AI-generated summary
- `suggested_action`: Recommended next steps

## Usage Example

When an email arrives with subject containing "NSF CHECK RETURNED":

```json
{
  "action_code": "NSF CHECK RETURNED",
  "category": "Failed payment",
  "ghl_stage": "FDPF Insufficient Funds",
  "ghl_note": "Failed Payment due to insufficient Funds\n\nNeed to call client back and schedule a policy redate",
  "indication": "NSF CHECK RETURNED - Insufficient Funds",
  "reason": "NSF CHECK RETURNED",
  "suggested_action": "Contact client to schedule policy redate"
}
```

## Testing

To test the updated function:

1. Find a Royal Neighbors email in your inbox
2. Run the analysis function on it
3. Check the `email_analysis_results` table
4. Verify `action_code`, `ghl_note`, and `ghl_stage` fields are populated correctly

## Benefits

✅ **Automated Note Generation**: Pre-formatted notes based on status codes
✅ **Consistent Routing**: GHL stages ensure proper workflow assignment
✅ **Improved Accuracy**: AI trained on specific RNA status codes
✅ **Reduced Manual Work**: Status codes automatically mapped to actions
✅ **Better Tracking**: Original RNA codes preserved in action_code field

## Notes

- The function maintains backward compatibility with general categories
- Partial matching ensures flexibility for variations in status code format
- All RNA-specific terminology is preserved in the analysis
- The system can be easily extended with additional status codes

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy function (COMPLETED - Version 14)
2. ⏳ Test with real RNA emails
3. ⏳ Monitor AI accuracy on status code detection
4. ⏳ Add more status codes as needed
5. ⏳ Consider implementing similar mapping for other carriers (AETNA, ANAM, etc.)
