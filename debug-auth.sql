-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to check and fix auth policies

-- Check if there are any restrictive RLS policies on auth schema
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'auth';

-- If there are restrictive policies, you might need to update them
-- This is usually not the issue, but worth checking

-- Also check if your Supabase project has the right settings:
-- 1. Go to Authentication â†’ Settings in Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. Make sure "Enable email confirmations" is set correctly
-- 3. Check "Site URL" is set to your domain
-- 4. Check "Redirect URLs" includes your logout redirect

-- Common fix for logout 403 errors:
-- The issue is often that the JWT token is invalid or expired
-- The local signout approach should fix this
